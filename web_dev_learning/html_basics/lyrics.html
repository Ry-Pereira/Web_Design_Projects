        <h1>The Reaper</h1>
        <h2>By: Keshi</h2>
        <pre>I'm fallin' in deeper
She's callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it
Just let me go, no
But something brings me back to you
She wouldn't tell me why
It's time to say goodbye
What did you do?
What did you do?
Baby, just tell me lies
We runnin' out of time
Say that she can't decide (no)
It's up to you, it's up to you
We gonna live or die?
Lay me to rest in peace, yeah
Don't want your honesty, yeah
I wanna see you when you're lying right here next to me
She don't want me, but I burn inside
She don't wanna keep this heart of mine
She don't wanna leave, just one time
But when I fall asleep, give me cyanide
I'm fallin' in deeper
She's callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it
Just let me go, no
But something brings me back to you
Love me, let me know
Stay or should I go?
Know that she was never mine to hold
Reaping what I sow
Taking what I owe
When she come to take another soul
I'm fallin' in deeper
She's callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it
Just let me go, no
But something brings me back to you
I'm fallin' in deeper
She's callin' my keeper
I wanted the reaper
Will end it
Just let me go, no
But something brings me back to you
</pre>
